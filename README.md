# Development Guide

## Folder structure

Each of the files are located in their respective context folders in `/src/`. Handsfree.js specific scripts are named `handsfree.js` and the Mozilla WebXR specific ones are labeled `webxr.js`. Other than organizing the files the WebXR code is mostly untouched.

## How it works (Reference: [Handsfree.js repo](https://github.com/midiblocks/handsfree))

![](https://i.imgur.com/VKFeZpB.jpg)

- When you first install the extension, `/src/background/handsfree.js` checks if you've approved the webcam. If not, then it'll open the options page in `src/options/stream-capture.html`
- The popup panel has a "Start/Stop Webcam" button that communicates with the background script to start the webcam: `/src/popup/index.html`
- The background page is where the models are stored and run. This keeps everything isolated and only asks for webcam permission once (vs on every domain): `/src/background/handsfree.js`
- The background page also uses the "Picture in Picture" API to "pop the webcam" out of the browser. It renders the webcam feed and debug canvases into a single canvas, and uses that as the `srcObject` to a separate video element which is the PiP'ed

> Remark: Handsfree's "Picture in Picture" API will be disable in this Chrome Extension

## How to shutdown chrome extension
> Remark: Directly refresh Chrome Extension in `chrome://extensions` will cause last time sheetCode auto fill in and input tag read-only. In order to solve this, just start the model and stop the model to update the sheetCode to empty string. 
1. Open popup.js by clicking the extension
2. Click <kbd>Stop Model</kbd> to shutdown chrome extension
